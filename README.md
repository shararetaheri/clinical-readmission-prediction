# Clinical Readmission Prediction

Predict 30-day hospital readmission risk using structured clinical data.

## Overview
This project uses machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict hospital readmission within 30 days. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## Features
- Interpretable Logistic Regression
- Baseline Random Forest comparison
- Evaluation metrics: AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Feature importance analysis
- Saves trained models for reuse

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clinical-readmission-prediction.git
cd clinical-readmission-prediction
# Clinical Readmission Prediction & Advanced Decision Support

Predict 30-day hospital readmission risk using machine learning and provide advanced clinical decision support recommendations.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a full AI workflow for predicting hospital readmission:

1. Predictive Modeling – Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
2. Advanced Clinical Decision Support – Risk stratification, confidence intervals, fairness check, and cost-sensitive recommendations.  
3. Human-readable output – Recommendations are interpretable for clinical decision-making.

The project is designed for research, education, and demonstration purposes with sample placeholder data.
